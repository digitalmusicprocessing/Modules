  We're going to have our first module musical statement now! We just saw how to use convolution to imagine a sound as if it were played in a different environment.  Now you should do this with your own example, and we will create a class gallery!  You will need to gather an impulse response for your environment and a tune you want to play in that environment.  To create your impulse response, you should clap somewhere and record it (if you can't come up with any ideas, you can steal them from <a href = "http://www.echothief.com/">echo thief</a>).  Then, convolve this with some tune of your choosing.
