<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Audio is commonly <b>sampled</b> at 44100 hz, or <b>samples per second</b>.  In other words, the computer (via an "analog to digital converter") measures the position of the microphone fiber 44100 times per second, and this gets stored as a 1D array in the computer.</li>
</ul>
