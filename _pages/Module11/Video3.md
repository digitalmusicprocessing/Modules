Watch the two videos below from Khan Academy that explain what happens when we introduce the number <b>i</b> to our number system.  Then complete a few brief questions at <a href = "https://ursinus.instructure.com/courses/15546/quizzes/21956">this link</a>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>
 <b>i</b> is defined so that <b>i*i = -1</b>.  There's no way we could do this with any real number, so this opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for numbers that we can have.  In our next class, we'll use a special relationship for complex numbers known as Euler's formula to help us define the DFT in a more succinct way.  Euler's formula is as follows:

<h3>
\[ e^{i \theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta) \]
</h3>
